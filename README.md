#Redux10

This is a visual overview of the basics of Redux in 10 steps.


###Motivation
I had read a lot about the Redux JS library, but some of it just did not click,
until I drew a diagram.

So I wanted to see if it was possible to grasp the basics of Redux with React in 10 steps.
By using a basic diagram of Redux I better understood how it worked and the terminology.

Redux is quite simple and elegant, but plugging it into work with React can be tricky the first time.

So I built this little overview using a basic single page using React with Redux to explain Redux.

###How it works
Unpack the project and run the index.html file. Set up to be run locally without a web server.

Uses Welly to load the scripts. Has a simple 0-10 menu system at top to take you through what Redux is and how it works.
The examples are the Redux code I used to create the Redux store.

It is basic, but can help the visual side of Redux basics. Hopefully it is of help to someone who nearly grasps Redux but just needs that last picture to see it all.
